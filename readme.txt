The project is run from the file named mainGame.py. 
Run this file, and a 600X600 Tkinter window will pop up, initiating the game. Note that keyboard presses and optional mouse presses are needed to play the game. This project uses Tkinter GUI package.
This project is an interactive maze solving game. In this project, a User starts at one end of a two-dimensional maze (the upper left corner) and must reach the designated ending (marked as the lower right corner) to win the game. The story in the game is that the User must save a victim by reaching their position at the end of the maze. All mazes are randomly generated and their complexity is based on the difficulty level the User chooses for the game. The User has the option to switch “maze versions”. This project has three different maze versions: Regular, Hidden, and Scroll. A regular maze is the conventional 2D maze with walls. A Hidden maze has a visible opening surrounding the User, such that they cannot see the whole maze. A Scroll maze is a “zoomed-in” version of a maze such that when the User moves, the maze moves (because only a subset of the rows/columns of the overarching maze are visible at any given time). All mazes have at least one solution. Also, all mazes can be converted from the current version to another version of the maze during the game. Additionally, the User has the option to add enemies into the game (a yes or no option). The number, strength, and location of the enemies is pseudorandom and based on algorithm(s). If the User runs into an enemy, then they lose a certain amount of health. The game is lost when a User loses all their health, or when the victim loses all their health (the victim is always losing some health). Lastly, the game has a story theme based off the popular show, “Stranger Things”, which is seen in the animations.
